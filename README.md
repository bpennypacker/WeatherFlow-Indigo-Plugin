# WeatherFlow-Indigo-Plugin
Indigo Plugin for obtaining weather data from WeatherFlow

This plugin lets you incorporate WeatherFlow data into Indigo in multiple ways. You can obtain curated weather data from WeatherFlow servers and/or raw weathr data from your own WeatherFlow devices on the same network as your Indigo server.
